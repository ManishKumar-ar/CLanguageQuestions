//output
//Left shift operation result for INT16_MIN: 0
//Overflow occurred for INT16_MIN!

//For INT16_MIN: The value -32768 << 1 results in -65536, but due to overflow, it is interpreted as 0 in a 16-bit signed integer.
//The program detects this overflow by comparing the result with a_min, and since 0 is greater than -32768, it correctly reports that overflow occurred.
