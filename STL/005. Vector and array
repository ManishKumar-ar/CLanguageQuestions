#include <iostream>
#include <array>
using namespace std;

int arr[10000000]; // globally that is 10^7      ---int, char , double types

int arr[100000000]; // globally that is 10^8      ---boolean types


int main()
{

    // maximum size of the array that be declare inside the main fucntoon of any int, char , double types

    int arr[1000000]; // that is 10^6 in case of ---int, char , double types


    int arr[1000000]; // that is 10^7     in case of boolean 

}

//so due to above things, we have to need something where we didn't need to specify the size.
we need something, where we can define the size later, not at the time of creation.

solution - vector
