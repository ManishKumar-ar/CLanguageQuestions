The constructor vector<int> vec2(vec.begin(), vec.begin() + 2); 
effectively creates a new vector vec2 that contains the elements from the beginning of vec up to, but not including, the element at the position pointed to by vec.begin() + 2.

After this operation, vec2 will contain the elements {10, 20}, as it is constructed using the first two elements of vec.
It's important to note that the range constructor used here includes the element at the first iterator but excludes the element at the second iterator.
