// in main() funciton for integers =  arr[10^6] possible                        

//outside main() funciton or globally for integer =  arr[10^7]
//                             










//but there is a problem in the hashing also - if our maximum array element is 10^9 then we have to create an hashing array of size 10^9 + 1  ---> that is not possible.
//  solution - we don't know
