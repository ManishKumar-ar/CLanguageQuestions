leaf year -  all year which are perfectly divisible by 4 are the leaf years.
but execpt for the century years( years ending with 00) which is a leaf year only if it was perfectly divisible by 400.
for example -
leaf year ========  2012,2016,2020,2024, 2000, 2400, 1200
non leaf year ====== 1700, 1800, 1900

#include<iostream> 
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int year;
    cout << "Enter a year: ";
    cin >> year;
    if (year % 4 == 0)
    {
        if (year % 100 == 0)
        {
            if (year % 400 == 0)
                cout << year << " is a leap year.";
            else cout << year << " is not a leap year.";
        }
        else cout << year << " is a leap year.";
    }
    else cout << year << " is not a leap year.";
    return 0;
}
