The reason the code inside the if statement is not executed is due to the short-circuiting behavior of the logical AND (&&) operator.

In C++, the logical AND operator (&&) evaluates the second operand only if the first operand is true. 
If the first operand is false, the second operand is not evaluated because the overall result is already determined to be false.


a > b is true (since 10 > 5).
However, for the entire condition to be true, both parts must be true.
The second part ++i <= b is false because ++i is evaluated first, incrementing i to 6, and then it checks if 6 is less than or equal to b (which is 5).
Since the second part is false, the overall condition is false, and the code inside the if block (cout << "hello \n";) is not executed.
