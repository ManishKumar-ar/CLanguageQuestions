#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
 
   int arr[5]={10,5,6,8,96};

    sort(arr,arr+5);                              //the time complexity of sort() in stl is O( nlogn )

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        cout << arr[i]<<" ";
}

// output
// 5 6 8 10 96 

//note - 
//the sort function can be impleted by the ----merge sort and ---quick sort
// the worst time complexity sis  O(n^2).


arr + 0 would point to the first element.
arr + 1 would point to the second element.
arr + 2 would point to the third element.
arr + 3 would point to the fourth element.
arr + 4 would point to the fifth element.
arr + 5 would point to the element just beyond the fifth element (one past the end of the array).
So, arr + 5 points to the element after the 5th element of the array, effectively giving us the end iterator for the range we want to sort.
